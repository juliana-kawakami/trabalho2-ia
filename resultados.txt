One of the main goals in Affective Computing research
isAutomatic Affect Prediction (AAP) – providing computers
with a human-like ability to detect or anticipate affective
states from multi-modal sensor data [1].;;Finally, we use our framework for 2) discussing examples
of context-sensitivity-related challenges for addressing QIs in
data collection setups.;;These models are typically constructed
using supervised machine-learning algorithms, which rely heavily
on labeled training datasets.;;Qualities of Indeterminacy (QIs) :describe a series of
inherent characteristics of Affective Meaning, contributing to
its variability, complexity, and interpretative diversity.
Extracting_the_features_of_emotion_from_EEG_signals_and_classify_using_affective_computing.pdf;;The row of the matrix multiplied with the predictedvalues gives the target value S.
The purpose of the classiﬁer is to locate the response centers
of each emotion.;;Abstract —The extraction of features, for the recognition of
affective states through various means such as gestures of the
body, facial images and electroencephalogram (EEG), is very
important in affective computing.;;Features of EEG data are extracted using
independent component analysis (ICA), and are classiﬁed usingK Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm.;;A novel method for emotion recognition from the EEG
data is presented in the subsequent sections.
The_Appliance_of_Affective_Computing_in_Man-Machine_Dialogue_Assisting_Therapy_of_Having_Autism.pdf;;Picard team designed an emotional dialogue system, 
virtual human "Laura" can communicate with users through 
text interface experience physical exercise: if exercises 
complete objectives, Laura will commend him; if exercises 
not complete objectives, Laura will encourage him.;;How to combine affective computing 
with man-machine dialogue is a significative research problem 
so that it can cause emotional communion when the computers 
are used by children.;;I try to introduce affective computing in 
the field of human-computer dialogue, identify and extract 
emotional information through the tested object, give the 
emotional intervention and, based on the specific research 
outcome, indicate its feasibility and effectiveness.;;
Ethical_Considerations_on_Affective_Computing_An_Overview.pdf;;It aims to reflect the complexities inherent in both the technol-
ogy and current ethical discussions.;;Common images of the issues
invite oversimplification and offer a limited understanding of
the moral consequences and ethical tensions.;;However,
the limits of recognition technology mean that actions are
likely to be based on impoverished representations of peo-
ple’s affective state, particularly with certain groups; systems
are liable to arouse feelings that are positive, but not well
grounded in reality, affectively engaging systems can become
addictive and manipulative, and they confer dangerous power
on those who control the technology.;;We offer an overview of
those and other particular ethical issues, positive and nega-
tive, which arise from the current state of affective computing.
Context-Dependent_Deep_Learning_for_Affective_Computing.pdf;;Another set of works modified pre-trained languagemodels’ pre-training objective by incorporating sentiment se-
mantics [13] or by using auxiliary sentiment-related objectives
such as sentiment word masking and sentiment word predic-
tion [14] to improve fine-grained sentiment classification.;;Yet these
models face a number of challenges such as generalizing to
different test conditions and predicting fine-grained emotions to
name a few.;;For instance, take the case of text-based
emotion recognition systems where numerous approaches have
been proposed to date [5], [6], however, most of these works
focus on detecting a limited number of emotions comprising
of 6 to 8 emotions.;;
Affective_Game_Computing_A_Survey.pdf;;Importantly, the context of the game environment, the
game genre, the form of interfacing, the number of play-
ers, potential social aspects of the game, and the overall
objective of the game are foundational and they impact any
other in-game elicitor covered here.;;This article concludes with a
discussion on the current limitations of affective game com-
puting and our vision for the most promising future research
directions in the field.;;ABSTRACT |This article surveys the current state-of-the-art
in affective computing (AC) principles, methods, and tools as
applied to games.;;In addition, we provide a taxonomy of terms, methods, and
approaches used across the four phases of the affective game
loop and situate the field within this taxonomy.
Continual_Learning_for_Adaptive_Affective_Human-Robot_Interaction.pdf;;Driven by advancements in affective computing and deep
learning, social robots aim to recognise affective, social clues
such as emotion for interaction.;;Not to
mention that most existing deep learning methods and datasets
ignore the important variability factors such as socio-cultural
dynamics [12], the spontaneity of facial behaviour [13], and
interpersonal traits on expressiveness, gender, and age.;;Existing deep learning based
affective computing models for human-robot interaction are
based on static data distribution; however, in the ever-changing
real-world environment, the static nature of data distributions
gets invalid.;;This research will contribute to the domain of continual
learning.
On_Prompt_Sensitivity_of_ChatGPT_in_Affective_Computing.pdf;;{base prompt}
Python Expert You are a world-class expert at Python programming, your main objective is trying to help in Python
programming tasks.;;We perform our
evaluation on ChatGPT within the scope of affective computing
on three major problems, namely sentiment analysis, toxicity
detection, and sarcasm detection.;;Despite the
existence of some prompting techniques, the field is still rapidly
evolving and many prompting ideas still require investigation.;;Helpfulness is
defined as how well does the model follow the instructions
given in the prompt, which results in a cooperative response
to the questions (regardless of correctness).We select three affective computing tasks for our method,
since they have clearly defined binary labels, hence making it
clear to define correctness and helpfulness; this contributes di-
rectly to the ability of running a large scale Monte Carlo anal-
ysis to examine the different generation parameters.
Ethical_Risks_Concerns_and_Practices_of_Affective_Computing_A_Thematic_Analysis.pdf;;Our aim
was to explore how the affective computing research community
perceives risks and concerns related to ethics in this field, and
how they attempt to address and mitigate these risks.;;Subsequently,
we coded the data using Atlas.ti, to identify all mentions
oflimitations ,risks/concerns , and mitigation strategies.;;•RQ2: What are approaches proposed by af-
fective computing researchers to mitigate these
risks?;;We report
our findings of this thematic analysis along with an evaluation of
the potential impact of the regulations such as The EU AI Act
on the field of affective computing.
Affective_Computing_as_a_Tool_for_Understanding_Emotion_Dynamics_from_Physiology_A_Predictive_Modeling_Study_of_Arousal_and_Valence.pdf;;Our work takes advantage of this opportunity 
by using the Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion 
(CASE) dataset [7] and participating in the Emotion 
Physiology and Experience Collaboration (EPiC) 2023 
competition [8], aiming to bridge the gap between affective 
computing and affective science by studying the temporal 
dynamics of emotions.;;Our work takes advantage of this opportunity 
by using the Continuously Annotated Signals of Emotion 
(CASE) dataset [7] and participating in the Emotion 
Physiology and Experience Collaboration (EPiC) 2023 
competition [8], aiming to bridge the gap between affective 
computing and affective science by studying the temporal 
dynamics of emotions.;;Abstract — Affective computing has traditionally relied on 
predictive models that use summary annotations to understand 
emotions, an approach that often fails to capture the continuous 
nature of emotions.;;Our contributions include the development and 
comparison of predictive models for different affective 
dimensions, demonstrating that arousal models outperform 
valence models, a finding consistent with existing affective 
science literature.
